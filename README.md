# CS428Project1
This project uses Unity and Vuforia to create an AR experience with knickknacks. 
It includes two knickknacks based on two different locations(Hue, Vietnam and Matamata, New Zealand) 
The knickknacks displays beautiful models on top of a box. Each side of the box shows something unique about the location 
such as weather, a magic8 ball, and photos of the place. 
This project can also deploy to IOS.
